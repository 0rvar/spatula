/**
 * Introduction
Chef is a programming language in which programs look like recipes.

NEW: Additional syntax specifications added 17 July, 2003, marked in red. Fixed spelling of "liquefy" keyword.

Design Principles
Program recipes should not only generate valid output, but be easy to prepare and delicious.
Recipes may appeal to cooks with different budgets.
Recipes will be metric, but may use traditional cooking measures such as cups and tablespoons.
Language Concepts
Ingredients
All recipes have ingredients! The ingredients hold individual data values. All ingredients are numerical, though they can be interpreted as Unicode for I/O purposes. Liquid ingredients will be output as Unicode characters, while dry or unspecified ingredients will be output as numbers.

Mixing Bowls and Baking Dishes
Chef has access to an unlimited supply of mixing bowls and baking dishes. These can contain ingredient values. The ingredients in a mixing bowl or baking dish are ordered, like a stack of pancakes. New ingredients are placed on top, and if values are removed they are removed from the top. Note that if the value of an ingredient changes, the value in the mixing bowl or baking dish does not. The values in the mixing bowls and baking dishes also retain their dry or liquid designations.

Multiple mixing bowls and baking dishes are referred to by an ordinal identifier - "the 2nd mixing bowl". If no identifier is used, the recipe only has one of the relevant utensil. Ordinal identifiers must be digits followed by "st", "nd", "rd" or "th", not words.

Syntax Elements
The following items appear in a Chef recipe. Some are optional. Items must appear in the order shown below, with a blank line (two newlines) between each item.

Recipe Title
The recipe title describes in a few words what the program does. For example: "Hello World Souffle", or "Fibonacci Numbers with Caramel Sauce". The recipe title is always the first line of a Chef recipe, and is followed by a full stop.

recipe-title.

Comments
Comments are placed in a free-form paragraph after the recipe title. Comments are optional.

Ingredient List
The next item in a Chef recipe is the ingredient list. This lists the ingredients to be used by the program. The syntax is

Ingredients.
[initial-value] [[measure-type] measure] ingredient-name
[further ingredients]

Ingredients are listed one per line. The intial-value is a number, and is optional. Attempting to use an ingredient without a defined value is a run-time error. The optional measure can be any of the following:

g | kg | pinch[es] : These always indicate dry measures.
ml | l | dash[es] : These always indicate liquid measures.
cup[s] | teaspoon[s] | tablespoon[s] : These indicate measures which may be either dry or liquid.
The optional measure-type may be any of the following:

heaped | level : These indicate that the measure is dry.
The ingredient-name may be anything reasonable, and may include space characters. The ingredient list is optional. If present, it declares ingredients with the given initial values and measures. If an ingredient is repeated, the new vaue is used and previous values for that ingredient are ignored.

Cooking Time
Cooking time: time (hour[s] | minute[s]).

The cooking time statement is optional. The time is a number.

Oven Temperature
Pre-heat oven to temperature degrees Celsius [(gas mark mark)].

Some recipes require baking. If so, there will be an oven temperature statement. This is optional. The temperature and mark are numbers.

Method
Method.
method statements

Auxiliary Recipes
These are small recipes which are needed to produce specialised ingredients for the main recipe (such as sauces). They are listed after the main recipe. Auxiliary recipes are made by sous-chefs, so they have their own set of mixing bowls and baking dishes which the head Chef never sees, but take copies of all the mixing bowls and baking dishes currently in use by the calling chef when they are called upon. When the auxiliary recipe is finished, the ingredients in its first mixing bowl are placed in the same order into the calling chef's first mixing bowl.

For example, the main recipe calls for a sauce at some point. The sauce recipe is begun by the sous-chef with an exact copy of all the calling chef's mixing bowls and baking dishes. Changes to these bowls and dishes do not affect the calling chef's bowls and dishes. When the sous-chef is finished, he passes his first mixing bowl back to the calling chef, who empties it into his first mixing bowl.

An auxiliary recipe may have all the same items as a main recipe.

If at any check the value of ingredient is zero, the loop exits and execution continues at the statement after the "until". Loops may be nested.
